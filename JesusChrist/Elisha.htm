									<p>The time was about 150 years after King David reigned over Israel and several years after the earlier prophet Elijah had been sent to confront the nation, which had become steeped in idol worship. After being humbled by a severe drought and famine, Israel was on the path of returning to true worship.</p>

<p>At the end of Elijah&rsquo;s lifework, a spiritual revival, however small it seemed, had begun. Be sure to read the article &ldquo;<a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/prophecy/prophets/prophets-of-the-bible/elijah-the-prophet" target="_blank">Elijah the Prophet</a>&rdquo; to see how God got the attention of the nation. Elisha&rsquo;s prophetic mission would now prepare Israel for further religious reforms.</p>

<p>Elisha was an Old Testament <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/bible/holy-bible/old-testament/the-prophets" target="_blank">prophet</a> who lived around 800 B.C., a time when God involved Himself in a very direct way with the people and the leadership of ancient Israel. Around this period, God sent at least 30 prophets, between the northern kingdom of Israel and the southern kingdom of Judah, in an effort to turn their citizens away from idolatry and other sins.</p>

<h3>Elisha the man</h3>

<p><a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/god" target="_blank">God</a>, who sees in secret, always knows all who are His, and He had earlier declared to Elijah that there were 7,000 persons in Israel who had not done homage to Baal during a very wicked time (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 19:18<br>18 Yet I have reserved seven thousand in Israel, all whose knees have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 19:18</a>).</p>

<p>As Elijah was nearing the end of his ministry, God directed him to anoint a younger man named Elisha to take his place. Elisha, son of Shaphat, was from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel-meholah" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Abel Meholah</a>, of the Jordan Valley (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 19:16<br>16 Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi as king over Israel. And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel Meholah you shall anoint as prophet in your place.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 19:16</a>). After a few years of training, Elisha would become God&rsquo;s spokesman to the northern kingdom; and his ministry would be filled with signs and miracles, proclamations and warnings. He would become known as the prophet of peace and healing.</p>

<h3>Starting as a disciple</h3>

<p>Elijah was divinely directed by God to seek his successor, and Elijah found Elisha out in a field plowing on his father&rsquo;s farm. Elijah placed his mantle (an outer garment, like a cloak) on Elisha&rsquo;s shoulders, and Elisha apparently understood this symbolic act as being appointed to the role of a prophet. Without hesitation, Elisha accepted the call to service, leaving the comfort of his family and home to follow a less predictable life that would require personal sacrifice (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 19:19-21<br>19 So he departed from there, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he was with the twelfth. Then Elijah passed by him and threw his mantle on him.<br />
20 And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah, and said, &ldquo;Please let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you.&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;Go back again, for what have I done to you?&rdquo;<br />
21 So Elisha turned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen and slaughtered them and boiled their flesh, using the oxen&rsquo;s equipment, and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and followed Elijah, and became his servant.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 19:19-21</a>).</p>

<p>Elisha began his ministry as Elijah&rsquo;s student and personal attendant. The young man would first prove himself faithful in small things, such as the humble duty of pouring water on the hands of Elijah (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Kings 3:11<br>11 But Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;Is there no prophet of the Lord here, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?&rdquo; So one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, &ldquo;Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.&rdquo;<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Kings 3:11</a>). Elisha&rsquo;s training under Elijah would gradually prepare him for a work that he would one day take up alone.</p>

<h3>The schools of the prophets</h3>

<p>The Bible mentions both Elijah and Elisha visiting centers of religious learning in Israel that were attended by groups of men called &ldquo;the sons of the prophets&rdquo; (for example, see <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Kings 20:35<br>35 Now a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor by the word of the Lord, &ldquo;Strike me, please.&rdquo; And the man refused to strike him.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Kings 20:35</a>; <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Kings 2:3, 5, 7, 15<br>3 Now the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, &ldquo;Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Yes, I know; keep silent!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
5 Now the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, &ldquo;Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today?&rdquo; So he answered, &ldquo;Yes, I know; keep silent!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.<br />
<br />
15 Now when the sons of the prophets who were from Jericho saw him, they said, &ldquo;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&rdquo; And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Kings 2:3, 5, 7, 15</a>). Commenting on this phrase, Albert Barnes wrote it signifies &ldquo;the schools or colleges of prophets which existed in several of the Israelite, and probably of the Jewish, towns, where young men were regularly educated for the prophetical office. These &lsquo;schools&rsquo; make their first appearance under the prophet Samuel <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="1 Samuel 19:20<br>20 Then Saul sent messengers to take David. And when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as leader over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">1 Samuel 19:20</a>&rdquo; (<em>Albert Barnes&rsquo; Notes on the Bible</em>).</p>

<p>At the close of Elijah&rsquo;s ministry, on a round of service between three of these schools, Elisha&rsquo;s faith and resolution were tested three times. At Gilgal, at Bethel and again at Jericho, he was invited by Elijah to turn back (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Kings 2:1-7<br>1 And it came to pass, when the Lord was about to take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.<br />
2 Then Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Stay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to Bethel.&rdquo; But Elisha said, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!&rdquo; So they went down to Bethel.<br />
3 Now the sons of the prophets who were at Bethel came out to Elisha, and said to him, &ldquo;Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Yes, I know; keep silent!&rdquo;<br />
4 Then Elijah said to him, &ldquo;Elisha, stay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to Jericho.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!&rdquo; So they came to Jericho.<br />
5 Now the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho came to Elisha and said to him, &ldquo;Do you know that the Lord will take away your master from over you today?&rdquo; So he answered, &ldquo;Yes, I know; keep silent!&rdquo;<br />
6 Then Elijah said to him, &ldquo;Stay here, please, for the Lord has sent me on to the Jordan.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you!&rdquo; So the two of them went on.<br />
7 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood facing them at a distance, while the two of them stood by the Jordan.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Kings 2:1-7</a>). But Elisha had learned not to give up easily. Just like in his growing-up years walking behind a plow, now that he had set his hand to the &ldquo;plow&rdquo; of another much greater line of work, he would not be discouraged or distracted from his task.</p>

<h3>Elisha succeeds Elijah</h3>

<p>On the day that the prophet Elijah understood his ministry was coming to a close and that Elisha would take his place, Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;&lsquo;Ask! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?&rsquo; Elisha said, &lsquo;Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me&rsquo;&rdquo; (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Kings 2:9<br>9 And so it was, when they had crossed over, that Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Ask! What may I do for you, before I am taken away from you?&rdquo; Elisha said, &ldquo;Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.&rdquo;<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Kings 2:9</a>).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;double portion&rsquo; is that which denotes the proportion of a father&rsquo;s property which was the right of an eldest son (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="Deuteronomy 21:17<br>17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>). Elisha therefore asked for twice as much of Elijah&rsquo;s spirit as should be inherited by any other of the &lsquo;sons of the prophets.&rsquo; He wished to be acknowledged as Elijah&rsquo;s &lsquo;firstborn spiritual son&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>Albert Barnes&rsquo; Notes on the Bible,</em> 2 Kings 2:9).</p>

<p>Elisha didn&rsquo;t ask for worldly honor or for a high place among men. What he really desired was a large measure of the <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/god/holy-spirit" target="_blank">Holy Spirit</a> that God had so freely placed upon the prophet Elijah. He knew that He needed God&rsquo;s Holy Spirit to equip him for the responsibilities that lay ahead.</p>

<p>Elijah then answered, &ldquo;You have asked a hard thing. Nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it shall not be so&rdquo; (2 Kings 2:10). The Hebrew words in this verse mean that if Elisha would be given the privilege of seeing the miraculous way God would take Elijah away, then it would be a sign that his request would be granted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it happened, as they continued on and talked, that suddenly a chariot of fire appeared with horses of fire, and separated the two of them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. And Elisha saw it, and he cried out, &lsquo;My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!&rsquo;&rdquo; (2 Kings 2:11-12). God had suddenly taken Elijah out of service, and Elisha was privileged to watch the miraculous way in which his master departed.</p>

<p>Elisha reached down and picked up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from the prophet when he was taken away. This represented the authority God had given His prophet. Elijah had used it earlier that same morning in miraculously causing the waters of the Jordan River to divide (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="verse 8<br>8 Now Elijah took his mantle, rolled it up, and struck the water; and it was divided this way and that, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">verse 8</a>).</p>

<p>After picking up Elijah&rsquo;s mantle, Elisha went to the bank of the Jordan River to test whether the spirit of Elijah had really fallen upon him. Approaching the river, he asked, &ldquo;&lsquo;Where is the LORD God of Elijah?&rsquo; And when he also had struck the water, it was divided this way and that; and Elisha crossed over&rdquo; (verse 14).</p>

<p>The sons of the prophets also recognized that the &ldquo;spirit of Elijah&rdquo; now rested on Elisha, and they bowed before him in respect (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="verse 15<br>15 Now when the sons of the prophets who were from Jericho saw him, they said, &ldquo;The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.&rdquo; And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">verse 15</a>). Elisha then began his prophetic career, which likely lasted some 50 years, as it extended over the reigns of four kings of Israel: Jehoram, Jehu, Jehoahaz and Joash.</p>

<h3>Elisha&rsquo;s ministry differed from Elijah&rsquo;s</h3>

<p>The ministry of Elisha the prophet was different from that of Elijah in some regards. Elijah was commissioned to deliver fearless messages of condemnation and judgment to the king and to the people, warning them to turn from sin. Elisha&rsquo;s ministry was to build on the work that Elijah had begun by teaching the people God&rsquo;s ways.</p>

<p>Throughout his long and effective years of labor, Elisha continued to advance the important spiritual education that was so needed at the schools of the prophets.

<h3>Elisha&rsquo;s ministry of miracles</h3>

<p>Elisha&rsquo;s prophetic ministry included works of healing and restoration. The biblical record also shows Elisha bringing joy to people through miracles from God. His gentle spirit enabled him to have a positive influence on the lives of many in Israel and is revealed in several illustrations in 2 Kings 4-6.</p>

<p>Elijah&rsquo;s ministry began by shutting up the heavens for three and a half years, whereas Elisha&rsquo;s ministry began by healing a spring of water near Jericho (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Kings 2:19-22<br>19 Then the men of the city said to Elisha, &ldquo;Please notice, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the ground barren.&rdquo;<br />
20 And he said, &ldquo;Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it.&rdquo; So they brought it to him.<br />
21 Then he went out to the source of the water, and cast in the salt there, and said, &ldquo;Thus says the Lord: &lsquo;I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
22 So the water remains healed to this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Kings 2:19-22</a>). This spring possessed certain toxic qualities, and one complained to Elisha that it was unfit for drinking and had destroyed the foliage around it. Elisha asked to have some salt in a new bowl brought to him. Elisha tossed the salt into the gushing spring and the poison of the pool of water was suddenly healed.</p>

<p>The use of the salt was symbolic, as it was God who performed the miracle. God declared through the prophet, &ldquo;Thus says the LORD: &lsquo;I have healed this water; from it there shall be no more death or barrenness&rsquo;&rdquo; (2 Kings 2:21).</p>

<p>Elisha&rsquo;s second recorded miracle granted an impoverished family of faith a financial blessing. A student of one of the religious training centers died and his wife became a widow. She was very poor and owned just one marketable item of value, a jar of olive oil. She had two sons to care for, and she asked Elisha to help her as she feared her sons would be taken away to pay a debt.</p>

<p>Elisha instructed her to go to all her neighbors and borrow as many empty jars as she could. A miracle was going to occur that would allow her to fill every empty jar to the top by pouring from her one jar of olive oil. The one jar of oil was multiplied miraculously, and she was able to sell enough of the valuable oil to pay off her debt and live off the remainder (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Kings 4:1-7<br>1 A certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried out to Elisha, saying, &ldquo;Your servant my husband is dead, and you know that your servant feared the Lord. And the creditor is coming to take my two sons to be his slaves.&rdquo;<br />
2 So Elisha said to her, &ldquo;What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;Your maidservant has nothing in the house but a jar of oil.&rdquo;<br />
3 Then he said, &ldquo;Go, borrow vessels from everywhere, from all your neighbors&mdash;empty vessels; do not gather just a few.<br />
4 And when you have come in, you shall shut the door behind you and your sons; then pour it into all those vessels, and set aside the full ones.&rdquo;<br />
5 So she went from him and shut the door behind her and her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured it out.<br />
6 Now it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, &ldquo;Bring me another vessel.&rdquo;And he said to her, &ldquo;There is not another vessel.&rdquo; So the oil ceased.<br />
7 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, &ldquo;Go, sell the oil and pay your debt; and you and your sons live on the rest.&rdquo;<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Kings 4:1-7</a>).</p>

<p>Two additional miracles were wrought for a married couple dwelling in the town of Shunem. Elisha the prophet often stayed at the home of this childless couple, as his ministry would take him from town to town. As a gesture of appreciation for their hospitality he prophesied that they would have a son who would bring them great joy.</p>

<p>Later, the little boy suffered an illness while out in the field, and his mother went searching diligently until she found Elisha. The prophet went back to her house to see what could be done. The boy had died but Elisha prayed and God raised the boy from the dead (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Kings 4:8-22<br>8 Now it happened one day that Elisha went to Shunem, where there was a notable woman, and she persuaded him to eat some food. So it was, as often as he passed by, he would turn in there to eat some food.<br />
9 And she said to her husband, &ldquo;Look now, I know that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us regularly.<br />
10 Please, let us make a small upper room on the wall; and let us put a bed for him there, and a table and a chair and a lampstand; so it will be, whenever he comes to us, he can turn in there.&rdquo;<br />
11 And it happened one day that he came there, and he turned in to the upper room and lay down there.<br />
12 Then he said to Gehazi his servant, &ldquo;Call this Shunammite woman.&rdquo; When he had called her, she stood before him.<br />
13 And he said to him, &ldquo;Say now to her, &lsquo;Look, you have been concerned for us with all this care. What can I do for you? Do you want me to speak on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?&rsquo;&rdquo;She answered, &ldquo;I dwell among my own people.&rdquo;<br />
14 So he said, &ldquo;What then is to be done for her?&rdquo;And Gehazi answered, &ldquo;Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old.&rdquo;<br />
15 So he said, &ldquo;Call her.&rdquo; When he had called her, she stood in the doorway.<br />
16 Then he said, &ldquo;About this time next year you shall embrace a son.&rdquo;And she said, &ldquo;No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your maidservant!&rdquo;<br />
17 But the woman conceived, and bore a son when the appointed time had come, of which Elisha had told her.<br />
18 And the child grew. Now it happened one day that he went out to his father, to the reapers.<br />
19 And he said to his father, &ldquo;My head, my head!&rdquo; So he said to a servant, &ldquo;Carry him to his mother.&rdquo;<br />
20 When he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.<br />
21 And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut the door upon him, and went out.<br />
22 Then she called to her husband, and said, &ldquo;Please send me one of the young men and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God and come back.&rdquo;<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Kings 4:8-22</a>; <a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Kings 4:23-37<br>23 So he said, &ldquo;Why are you going to him today? It is neither the New Moon nor the Sabbath.&rdquo; And she said, &ldquo;It is well.&rdquo;<br />
24 Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, &ldquo;Drive, and go forward; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you.&rdquo;<br />
25 And so she departed, and went to the man of God at Mount Carmel.So it was, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to his servant Gehazi, &ldquo;Look, the Shunammite woman!<br />
26 Please run now to meet her, and say to her, &lsquo;Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?&rsquo;&rdquo; And she answered, &ldquo;It is well.&rdquo;<br />
27 Now when she came to the man of God at the hill, she caught him by the feet, but Gehazi came near to push her away. But the man of God said, &ldquo;Let her alone; for her soul is in deep distress, and the Lord has hidden it from me, and has not told me.&rdquo;<br />
28 So she said, &ldquo;Did I ask a son of my lord? Did I not say, &lsquo;Do not deceive me&rsquo;?&rdquo;<br />
29 Then he said to Gehazi, &ldquo;Get yourself ready, and take my staff in your hand, and be on your way. If you meet anyone, do not greet him; and if anyone greets you, do not answer him; but lay my staff on the face of the child.&rdquo;<br />
30 And the mother of the child said, &ldquo;As the Lord lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So he arose and followed her.<br />
31 Now Gehazi went on ahead of them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice nor hearing. Therefore he went back to meet him, and told him, saying, &ldquo;The child has not awakened.&rdquo;<br />
32 When Elisha came into the house, there was the child, lying dead on his bed.<br />
33 He went in therefore, shut the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the Lord.<br />
34 And he went up and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands; and he stretched himself out on the child, and the flesh of the child became warm.<br />
35 He returned and walked back and forth in the house, and again went up and stretched himself out on him; then the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.<br />
36 And he called Gehazi and said, &ldquo;Call this Shunammite woman.&rdquo; So he called her. And when she came in to him, he said, &ldquo;Pick up your son.&rdquo;<br />
37 So she went in, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; then she picked up her son and went out.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Kings 4:23-37</a>).</p>

<h3>Lessons for today</h3>

<p>In all the service and miracles performed by Elisha the prophet, whether it was in response to sickness, death, financial need, hunger or to give wise counsel to kings, something to note is that God didn&rsquo;t prevent problems and trials in the lives of His people. Instead, God used these occasions to increase their <a href="https://lifehopeandtruth.com/change/faith/what-is-faith" target="_blank">faith</a> and trust in Him. God often allows problems and trials for our learning, for our experience and for our spiritual growth.</p>

<p>Numerous articles would be needed to explore each and every lesson we could draw from the life and work of Elisha the prophet. Studying the Bible stories and miracles in 1 Kings and 2 Kings can have an important impact on the diligent reader.</p>

<p>When we remember these stories, we can draw strength from them and understand that God is willing and able to help us with what we need, when we need it (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="2 Corinthians 9:8<br>8 And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work.<br> <hr><span style='font-size:.8em'>New King James Version (NKJV) <em>The Holy Bible, New King James Version &copy;1982 by Thomas Nelson</em></span>">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>); that He expects us to keep all of His commandments if we are to boldly come before Him in times of need (<a data-tooltip aria-haspopup="true" class="verse-reference has-tip tip-bottom" title="John 14:12-15<br>12 &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.<br />
13 And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.<br />
14 If you ask anything in My name, I will do it. Jesus Promises Another Helper<br />
