<blockquote>
People don't like to hear about hell. But I'm here to tell you that if Jesus is not your Lord and Savior, you are on your way to hell. Some of you will be upset at this bad news. You think that I'm all gloom and doom. Tell me this...if your house were on fire, would you want me to let you know? Of course you would. You'd probably thank me for telling you. Well, if you go to hell, <I>you</I> will be the one on fire--and your soul will be lost forever.
<p>Hell may not be a politically correct topic these days, but many people enter hell everyday. Out of the 120,000 people [probably more by now] that die everyday, most end up in hell. Hell is a real place in spite of the fact that people laugh and say that they want to go there. They simply don't understand how horrible hell is. Just because you've never seen hell doesn't mean it doesn't exist. We have descriptions of what hell is like in God's word (We'll get to some scriptures in a minute). Hell is dreadful--and if you don't believe in Jesus and obey him, you'd better get on the stick or else that's going to be your eternal destination.
<p>Satan, the god of this world, WILL NOT always cause havoc. His doom is already foretold, <i>"And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever." (Revelation 20:10) </i>
<p>Did you know that if you do not belong to Jesus Christ you belong to Satan? You don't have to be a card carrying Satanist to serve Satan. You don't have to be a murderer, drunkard or drug addict, either. The wages of sin is death--whether murder, being a drunkard, being a whoremonger, lying, coveting and desiring what is evil, fornication, dishonoring parents, etc. If you have not repented of your sins and believed in the blood of Jesus that was shed for your sins, then you are in trouble. If you do not read God's word and obey it, then you are in trouble. If you die in your sins, never repenting, never obeying God's word, you will go to hell.



<u>To be <a href=GetToHeaven1.htm>saved</a> from the wrath to come, we must REPENT of our sins, BELIEVE in the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, and OBEY his word (his commandments are not grievous, they are refreshing and life giving).</u> The Lord Jesus Christ rose from the dead and is now seated on the right hand of the throne of God EXPECTING TILL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE HIS FOOTSTOOL. All of this horrendous foolishess, wickedness, murder, and whoredom and blasphemy on the television, in the streets, in the books, etc. WILL NOT continue. There is a cup of iniquity that has to be filled and anybody that looks around can see that it is filling up fast these days. Judgment day is coming--quickly--<i>and we will all be there</i>. God alone will be exalted in that day and the books will be opened.



<p align=center>Revelation 20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</center>
<p>And, as we shall see shortly, they will not get out.
<p>How many times have I heard someone say, "A loving God wouldn't put his creatures in hell." Well I have news for you, friend, God <i>is</i> loving and he is not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance (II Peter 3:9). Hell is for the devil and his angels, and all the rebels that want to break God's laws on this earth--
<blockquote> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye
cursed, into <u>everlasting fire, PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS</u>. (Matthew
25:41) </blockquote>

<p>The devil is the god of this world (2 Corinthians 4:4)--men go to hell because they choose the devil's way and <a href="http://www.Jesus-is-Lord.com/myway.htm">reject</a> the Lord Jesus Christ. God is holy and will not allow any sin in his kingdom. As a result, when people die in their sins they are forever banished from the presence of God to hell and the lake of fire. They will go to a place of everlasting shame, contempt, and torment. Incidentally, Satan will not be ruling in the lake of fire. He will be condemned and tormented just like everybody else--
<blockquote>the devil...shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. (Revelation 20:10)</blockquote>
<p>Think about this...God, out of profound love for you--a vile sinner who has transgressed his commandments--sent his own beautiful, dear Son to this earth be sacrificed for YOUR sins! To save YOU! Jesus was not a sinner. He did not sin one time. He did not die for himself.

<a href=http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/easter2.htm>HE DIED FOR YOU.<a>




To take your punishment and to save YOU. That is why he is called the Saviour. Because he SAVES from sin and hell! If you reject his sacrifice and trod it underfoot it should not be too hard for you to understand that the same God who bruised his perfect, beloved, only begotten Son for your soul will expeditiously cast your rebellious hind parts into hell and the lake of fire. NOTHING unclean will ever enter God's heaven--and all unregenerate people are unclean.




My life quickly began to change as I read God's word, the Bible, and started obeying it.


<i>Holiness actually becomes a preference.</i> You do not have to be tormented forever in the lake of fire, you can be saved too--that is what God wants for you. The Bible teaches that God hath no pleasure in the death of wicked. He sent his only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to be the propitiation and payment for your sins so that you can be whole and live forever. For God so loved the world, that he gave us his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. God wants to save you and make you whole--.
<blockquote>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the L<font size=-1>ORD</font>: though your sins be
as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson,
they shall be as wool. </blockquote><p> (Isaiah 1:18)</p>
<p>God does not want you in hell! Jesus came to save you from that horrible place!
<a href="GetToHeaven1.htm">Get right</a> with Jesus and you won't go there! Look at these scriptures:
<blockquote>
<p>As I live, saith the Lord G<font size=-1>OD</font>, <u>I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die</u>... (Ezekiel 33:11)
<p>The Lord is...not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (II Peter
3:9)
</blockquote>


<p>The Bible teaches that God loves you so much that the Creator of this universe (the Lord Jesus Christ) came to "taste death" for every man. Jesus wasn't just some baby for a manger scene (we are not to make images and pictures of the Lord).



He is God manifested in the flesh who came to save you from both the guilt and power of sin--he holds the keys, people! If you say yes to Jesus, hell won't be your final destination. If you say no to Jesus, the lake of fire will be your eternal home. There is no getting out and no comfort--it is everlasting.
<p>Regardless of whether you believe it or not, hell exists and the Bible says that it is never full. I've heard folks say that hell is not mentioned in the Bible or that hell is just the grave.

<p>The following account, told by the Lord Jesus Christ in Luke 16:19-31, gives us the actual words of a man in hell--notice how he is in torment and he can see and he wanted his tongue cooled and he is tormented in the flame. Notice how he wanted his brethren to be warned lest they enter that place of torment. Notice how the only hope that his brethren had was to believe the holy scriptures--there would be no other proof:
<blockquote>19. There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
<p>20. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
<P>21. And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
<p>22. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
<P>23. And <u>in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments</u>, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
<P>24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, <u>have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame</u>.
<P>25. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
<p>26. And beside all this, <u>between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence</u>.
<p>27. Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
<p>28. For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, <u>lest they also come into this place of torment</u>.
<p>29. Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
<p>30. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
<p>31. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.
</blockquote>
<p>In order to be saved, you have to repent of your sins and believe that Jesus died for you, was buried, and rose again the third day.


If you continue in his word, the Holy Bible, then are you his disciple indeed. God has no pleasure that you should die in your sins. There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth (Luke 15:10). <i>Going to church will not save you.</i> You have to repent of your sins and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and obey his holy words until the end (These are the days of the falling away and false doctrine and apostasy, you need to read and study the Bible for yourself.). The thief (the devil) cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy: but the Lord Jesus Christ came that we might have life, and that we might have it more abundantly. The Lord Jesus Christ came to rescue us from sin and from the wages of sin which is death (physical death and everlasting torment in hell and the lake of fire).
<p>Hell is real and those who reject the Lord Jesus Christ will be tormented forever without a single, solitary hope. Hell is real
<a href=gettoheaven1.htm>but you can be saved</a>, if you repent. Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation (2 Corinthians 6:2). Now, while you are still alive, is the time when you can be accepted by God. Tomorrow is not promised to you--now is the time to make your decision. If you die in your sins, you will not be accepted and you will not get another chance to repent. You will be rejected. Heaven is for God's people. Unrepentant thieves, liars, whoremongers, atheists, agnostics, witches, murderers, sodomites, church hypocrites, <a href=religio.htm>false worshippers</a> (people who follow false religions (Roman Catholicism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.) which includes the various so-called "Christian" denominations or churches which make up their own anti-Biblical messages and lies about how to be saved, e.g. <a href=index.htm#rc>Roman Catholicism</a>, Jehovah's "Witnesses", <a href=mormon.htm>Mormons (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints)</a>, Charismatic, Pentecostal, Presbyterian, Seventh Day Adventist, "Church of Christ"/Campbellites, etc.), dispensationalist Baptist,
 all antinomians* (self-professed Christians who say that you can do whatever you want to do and still go to heaven),
  haters of God, adulterers, etc. have to go somewhere else,
  a place of outer darkness where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Both Jews and Gentiles (non-Jewish people) must be saved by the blood of Jesus. Nobody is good enough to make it into heaven on their own. All our righteousnesses are as filthy rags (reference Isaiah 64:6). ALL have sinned and come short of the glory of God. We ALL need the Lord Jesus Christ. We ALL need to REPENT of our sins, BELIEVE on the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ and OBEY his word.
<blockquote>*I find that many independent Baptists are <a href=http://www.jesus-is-lord.com/lordship.htm>antinomians</a>. They blasphemously say that Jesus will be your Saviour without being the Lord and Master of your life. They teach that you can do what you feel like doing and still go to heaven. In these perilous end-times, many church people are teaching this lie as they lead their followers into the arms of the devil himself.
</blockquote>
<p>BEWARE OF THE HELL BOUND CHURCH PEOPLE--ALL OF THEM! IF YOU FOLLOW THEIR DOCTRINES, YOU WILL GO TO HELL TOO! They will tell you that you can do whatever you feel like doing--doing all the sins you want to--and that you will still go to heaven. That is a lie from the devil and totally the opposite of what the Bible says. God is holy and commands his people to be holy. God's people are holy people. We have REPENTED and BELIEVED on the Lord Jesus Christ. We read his word and call on him as we put off the old man and his corrupt, unrighteous deeds. We have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus, no more are we the whoremongers, thieves, etc. Those things must go, and good riddance. It is time for the good, satisfying, upright life in God. We serve the Lord by working, organizing our homes, enjoying our children as we work with them on useful projects (food, clothing, shelter, water, fire, health), etc.
<blockquote>But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation; Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. I Peter 1:15-16 </blockquote>
<p>Nobody will sin their way into heaven. Heaven is not for the whoremongers, liars, and slayers of fathers and slayers of mothers. It is not for unrepentant murders and kidnappers, thieves, evil men and seducers--the unrepentant go to hell and the lake of fire. This is not hard to understand, just look around. Criminals go to jail and the penitentiary. Ephesians 5:5-6 says, For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. <b>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for BECAUSE OF THESE THINGS cometh THE WRATH OF GOD UPON the children of DISOBEDIENCE.</b> If you do not repent, believe AND follow the commands of Jesus, you are not saved (his commandments are not grievous). <i>If Jesus is not your Lord, the one you serve, he is not your Saviour, you are yet in your sins.</i> In these end times, men are being led into many grievous sins (if the reader is slave and servant to a grievous sin or sins, they can <a href=GetToHeaven1.htm>get saved</a> and then see our <a href=http://jesus-is-lord.com/deliverance.htm>Deliverance Series</a> for information for walking away from what held them bound.). We see in Revelation 13 that men will worship a man (the beast) AND the dragon (that old serpent called the Devil and SATAN) that gave power to the beast--sins are permissible in that kingdom. All that belong to it will be cast into the lake of fire. The beast is also called "the man of sin" (reference 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4).
<p>FLEE FROM "CONTEMPLATIVE PRAYER", "EMERGING 'CHURCH'", "CONTEMPLATIVE SPIRITUALITY" "ANCIENT FUTURE CHURCH", etc. In this movement, these people are learning and using black magic type occult techniques in churches! In disregard and disobedience to the Bible, THEY TELL PEOPLE TO CLEAR THEIR MINDS AND KEEP REPEATING THE NAME OF THE LORD OR SOME OTHER NAME. They say that focusing on the Bible is a hinderance to prayer--yes, the Bible is a hinderance to praying to the DEVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Praise the Lord!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stay away from people who want to teach you to pray to the devil calling the devil by the name of the Lord. Flee from anybody who puts down the word of God--they are doing that so that you will be defenseless against their lies. These are the end times and now church people are being deceived into CALLING AND SUMMONING DEVILS! The emerging church of the devil is using the same yoga-type techniques as hindus, buddhists Roman Catholic mystics, Greek orthodox mystics, occultists and other mystical traditions. The people are even warned about the possibility of encountering evil spirits during these exercises--no regular prayer requires a warning, no, no, no--BUT PRAYING TO THE DEVIL DOES!

AND WHEN THAT <a href=http://jesus-is-lord.com/kundalin.txt>KUNDALINI</a> SERPENT POWER RISES UP IN THESE PEOPLE, THEY WILL EITHER BECOME MAGICIANS OR GO INSANE OR SOME OTHER HORRIBLE THING--THERE ARE SYMPTOMS AND MANIFESTATIONS! CHURCH PEOPLE ARE GOING TOWARDS BEING POSSESSED! These are last days--BE WARE, DEAR ONE, BE WARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<a href=GetToHeaven1.htm>GET SAVED</a>, READ YOUR <a href=http://jesus-is-lord.com/thebible.htm>BIBLE</a> AND OBEY IT AND LEAVE
 THE <a href=http://jesus-is-lord.com/whats.htm>TELEVISION</a> ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <a href=http://jesus-is-lord.com/beast1.htm>THE BEAST IS COMING</a>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<P>One more thing: beware of "new age" teaching--you are not God, you are not divine, and God is not in everybody. All that pantheism (everything is God) and panentheism (God is in everything) is new age teaching which is actually old age because the devil told Eve in the garden, "Ye shall be as gods" (see <a href=KJB-PCE-GENESIS.htm>Genesis</a> chapter 3). The devil is a spirit--he is not dead and he has been telling that same lie ever since then. There is a lot more to this situation, but just get saved and obedient and live reconciled to God. Do not put your trust in science, etc. In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth--there is no <a href=index.htm#evolution>evolution</a>. Evolution is a big fat lie and a hoax to get people to disbelieve the word of God. Science...many, many lies are told by people in white labcoats. Believe and obey God's word and you will be safe and whole and of an understanding mind and not of a reprobate mind.
<p>Look around, the more the leaders make plans, the worse things get--child abuse, drug addiction, abortion, murders, shoplifting, lying, compulsive disorders, broken families, directionless young people, mind-killing school system, panic attacks, <a href=reprobate_mind_laws.htm>reprobate mind laws</a>, denying God and his word, etc. This thing called time is coming to an end. The heavens above and the earth beneath that you see before your eyes are going to be burned up completely and dissolved. <a href=dayoflrd.htm>The day of the Lord</a> is coming and we will all stand before God at the final judgment and the books are going to be opened. We will all be there--including all the dead people...they won't be left out--nobody will be left out.
<blockquote>
Revelation 20:11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.
<p>12 <b><u>And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</u></b>
<p>13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works.
<p>14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
<p>15 <b><u>And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.</u></b>
</blockquote>



<i>
<p><b>The Stakes Are High</b>
<p>What will happen if you die<br>
Rejecting the truth and trusting a lie?
<p>Where will you go and what will you do<br>
If the mouth of hell opens wide for you?
<p>Cast into the fire that will not cease<br>
There shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.
<p>Everlasting torment and everlasting shame<br>
To those who lived this life like it is one big game.
<p>Rebels will not recover from their fatal error<br>
An eternity awaits them full of terror.
<p>Flee, flee from the wrath to come<br>
You who have the gospel shunned.</i>
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>The Lord Jesus Christ died for your sins so that you should not perish. Just repent of your sins and believe in his death, burial, and resurrection and obey his holy word (his commandments are not grievous)--the Lord Jesus helps his people to obey as they try to obey. God sent his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, into the world because he so loved the world. <i>God is not willing that you should perish.</i>
<blockquote>
John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
