<H1>The Sinners Prayer</h1>


<h2>

Father, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you.
<p>


I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you.

<p>

Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again.

<p>


I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer.

<p>


I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward.


<p>


Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You,
and to do Your will for the rest of my life.

<p>


In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.
